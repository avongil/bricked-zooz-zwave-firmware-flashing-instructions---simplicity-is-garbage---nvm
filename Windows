# Bricked Zooz 800-Series Z-Wave Stick?  
Flash it in < 2 minutes — NO Simplicity Studio required  
(Works when the official Silicon Labs / Zooz method fails)

Tested December 2025 on Zooz ZST39 800 LR sticks that were hard-stuck in bootloader.

## WINDOWS (quick & dirty — 90 seconds)

```powershell
# 1. Install nvm for Windows (run PowerShell as Administrator once)
winget install nvm-windows

# 2. Install latest Node.js
nvm install latest
nvm list                     # note the version number
nvm use 20.18.0              # or whatever "latest" installed

# 3. Flash the stick (replace COM9 with whatever Device Manager shows)
npx @zwave-js/flash@latest COM9 Zooz_ZST39_800LR_US_1.60.gbl --verbose
